The Simple Steps to Making MONEYBAGS As a Freelancer

Step 1 - Choose a skill to offer for money.
* Identify a skill you possess that you can offer to others for a fee.
* If you don't have a skill, ask in the Beginner Chat what others are doing or you can get started with my Email Copywriting course.

Step 2 - Select a niche based on your interests.
* Pick a niche that aligns with your interests and knowledge.
* Don't waste time on niches you know nothing about.
* Test different niches and my recommendation is to go DEEP, not wide.
* Meaning, don’t do fitness, go into specific types of fitness.

Step 3 - Build your social media where your prospects hang out.
* Identify which social media platform your prospects use (Twitter, IG, Facebook)
* Build a following by posting valuable content and engaging with your target audience.
* If you’re stuck with how to do this, check out my Twitter, IG, or Facebook course.

Step 4 - Construct your offer by researching what other students are charging.
* To do this, you can ask my trained Captains in the Ask Captains chat or ask other students inside of the Beginner chat.
* Don't overthink it, I am here with you every step of the way.

Step 5 -  DM prospects daily - nobody knows you exist until you tell them.
* Your goal is to send 5-10 dms a day on IG, 5-30 dms a day on Twitter, FB 5-10 engagements daily.
* Based on feedback, refine your DM.
* Meaning, don’t keep sending the same DM expecting different results.
* As always, feel free to show us inside of the Beginner Chat.

Step 6 - Gather social proof by working in exchange for testimonials or charging less upfront.
* Offer to work for free or lower in exchange for testimonials.
* Social proof is essential to your marketing efforts.
* Remember we are in this for the long-term, not quick money.

Step 7 - Increase your prices as your results improve for clients.
* Focus on delivering great results for your clients before increasing your prices.
* Moneybag DOES NOT charge more based on theory, but on actual results.
* You only increase your price once it makes sense to pay you more.
* AKA you make more money than what they pay you.

Step 8 - Begin systemizing your process so that you can hire people when you're ready.
* Once you have a few clients and can afford it, hire someone to help you.
* Start by outsourcing the work you least enjoy and be clear about what you expect from your team.
* Meaning step by step what they should do and WHY you want it done that way.
* Then check up on them every few days as you complete work.
* I will expand more on this once you’ve earned $500 and have become a Certified Freelancer.
